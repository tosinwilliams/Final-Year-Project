The goal for this project was to technically explore the VR experience for mobile devices and its effect on users and to implement data visualization in VR 
The project uses a variety of models. Some custom made by me and some of free access.

## Navigation
For desktop the traditional gaming controls are available (WASD, arrow keys and mouse).
For mobile platforms (Google Cardboard), Navigation is done using teleport discs and clicking the red cursor.

## System Implementation

### Link Portals
I inserted 3 link portals which allowed entry to the other scenes in the app. 
One was for mobile users another was for Desktop users and the third one was to access the data visualization.

### User Interaction

I added user interaction in VR in the form of an intercative poster. The image changes for the user each time it is clicked.
